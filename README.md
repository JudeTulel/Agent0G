# Agent0G
A platform for agent builders to build and rent agents on the 0G L1 
## The Problem
AI is termed as the 4th industrial revolution the next big thing after the internet, but access remains centralized. Major cloud providers control the infrastructure, pricing, and availability of AI models. Startups, indie developers, and global innovators face high costs, complex setups, and limited flexibility.

## The solution
Agent0G changes this. By combining the 0G Compute Network, 0G Storage, and OG Chain, we create a fully decentralized platform where:

- Developers build AI agents using a no-code visual interface simmilar to n8n workflow
- Users rent agents via smart contracts
- AI workloads run on a global, decentralized GPU network provided for by the 0G blockchain
- All data and logic remain private, verifiable, and uncensorable

## Vision
To create a global, open marketplace where anyone can:

- Build AI agents visually
- Publish them to a decentralized registry
- Rent them securely via smart contracts
- Run them on decentralized, low-cost compute

## Revenue
 - 3% of all rental transactions
